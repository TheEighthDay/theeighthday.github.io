## About Me

I am an algorithm engineer at [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/). I received my M.S. in Computer Science from [Renmin University of China (RUC)](https://www.ruc.edu.cn/) in 2023, advised by Prof. [Xirong Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6m-ZQ1EAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) at [AIMC Lab](https://ruc-aimc-lab.github.io/). Before that, I received my B.E. in Software Engineering from [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/) in 2020. Prior to joining TikTok, I worked as an algorithm engineer at [Kuaishou Technology](https://www.kuaishou.com/) (2023–2025). I have also been a research intern at SenseTime and Kuaishou Technology during my graduate studies.
